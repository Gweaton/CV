## George Eaton

A Full-Stack Junior Software Developer, dedicated to XP practices, currently working as a contractor at HSBC on a pilot agile project in partnership with Pivotal Labs. I left the travel publishing industry to become a Software Developer and learn best practices from Makers Academy, London's leading 12-week Web Development bootcamp. Tech-agnostic, dedicated to Test-Driven Development and passionate about learning new languages, I’m looking for a second job with like-minded people where I can dive in at the deep end and make a difference from day one.

## Skills

#### Programming languages & frameworks
- Java (Spring Boot)
- Ruby (Rails/Sinatra)
- JavaScript (Angular/Node.js)
- PostgreSQL
- HTML,CSS (SASS)

#### Fast learner & problem solver
- I’ve been rapidly accruing new technologies since first learning to code. After learning the fundamentals of Ruby and Javascript at Makers Academy in just 3 months, my first software development role with HSBC required me to pick up Java/Spring Boot and TypeScript/Angular during the first few weeks on the job. I’m now confident enough to get stuck in with any language or framework and diagram my way through any challenges that present themselves.

#### Communication & people skills
- I developed excellent communication skills at Sawday’s, an online travel publishing company, as the first point of contact for customers, I provided friendly customer service and tech support via telephone and email in English, Spanish, and Italian.

- I’ve been pair-programming on a daily basis for the past year, both with colleagues at HSBC and Pivotal and students at Makers Academy, and am comfortable breaking down complex technical concepts and explaining them to others. Working closely with Product Managers at Pivotal, I’m confident in keeping key stakeholders in the loop about anything that may affect development.

#### Agile project support & training
- At Sawday's I assisted with a project to introduce a new CRM (Salesforce) to streamline our workflow and helped the development team with bug testing. I trained colleagues on the new systems, suggesting improvements after colleague feedback. This gave me my first exposure to agile methodologies.

- During my time with HSBC and Pivotal, I’ve assisted with user interviews and testing. Meeting users face-to-face and getting feedback on our product has been an invaluable experience, as it has forced us to keep those who use our app on a daily basis at the heart of the design for every feature we implement.

#### Attention to detail
- I’m meticulous with my test coverage, and through consistent Test-Driven Development I’m careful to leave nothing untested, particularly edge cases. If even the smallest tweak to my code affects my application in an unforeseen way, I want to know about it.
